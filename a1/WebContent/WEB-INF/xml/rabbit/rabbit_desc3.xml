<Overview>In "Rabbit Trail," you control the eponymous character, trying to collect all of the characters before other critters get you. You follow a static trail, using rabbit holes to climb from platform to platform. Jump to evade weasels and snag carrots. Later levels include hawks - and one badly timed jump could land you right in their claws.

Rabbit Trail is a Donkey Kong style clone.</Overview>
