<Overview>Mario finds himself pitted against a host of evil and nasty enemies. You must help him outwit the Spikes, Para-Goombahs, and other beasts and evils that lurk inside a tower that reaches to the clouds. After stunning a Koopa, he uses it as ammo against his enemies! The attack is relentless!

But watch out, there are also creatures made of fire and ice that must be avoided -- hazards at every turn. Even the narrow ledges on which Mario teeters and the pipes he races through must be traversed with caution!

The pace gets hotter at each level, and the action jumps right out at you! Hold on! This 3-D Virtual Boy game offers a white-knuckled adventure that will keep you on the edge of your seat!</Overview>
